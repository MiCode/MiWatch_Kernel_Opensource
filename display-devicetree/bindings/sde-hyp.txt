Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. SDE KMS HYP

Snapdragon Display Engine HYP registers with the Linux DRM/KMS framework to
facilitate DRM driver creation, publishing /dev/dri/card0, and sending
VBlank and Page Flip events to User Space listeners.

Required properties
- compatible: Must be "qcom,sde-kms-hyp"
- qcom,kms: Component phandle list

Component phandle list must include one KMS backend. In the driver WFD KMS
is provided as OpenWFD backend.

Required properties for OpenWFD backend:
- compatible: Must be "qcom,wfd-kms"
- qcom,client-id:	A four character string that is converted to a u32. It's
			understood as a hex value, if compatible (i.e. "7816").
			Otherwise, it is treated as a FourCC sequence code
			(i.e. "LV01").

Example:
	wfd_kms: qcom,wfd_kms@0 {
		compatible = "qcom,wfd-kms";
		qcom,client-id = "7816";
	};

	sde_kms_hyp: qcom,sde_kms_hyp@900000 {
		compatible = "qcom,sde-kms-hyp";
		qcom,kms = <&wfd_kms>;
	};
