	  If you want ASoC support, you should say Y here and also to the
	  specific driver for your SoC platform below.
	  
	  ASoC provides power efficient ALSA support for embedded battery powered
	  SoC based systems like PDA's, Phones and Personal Media Players.

	  This ASoC audio support can also be built as a module.  If so, the module
	  will be called snd-soc-core.

config SND_CTL_HASHTABLE
	bool "Add SND CTL hashtable"
	help
	  This enables hash table in sound card for kcontrols. The traditional way is
	  traversing the linked list of controls and compare each exsiting control with
	  the new kcontrol to find out whether there are duplicate kcontrols, which will
	  consumes much time during bootup. Enable this will use hash table instead of
	  linked list to check new kcontrol and reduce much time for sound card registration.

config DISABLE_SND_CTL_FIND_HOLE
	bool "Disable find hole"
	help
	  This disables find hole before adding new kcontrol for sound card. The function
	  snd_ctl_find_hole will consumes much time during bootup but it doesn't take effect
	  in some platforms. Enable this will bypass snd_ctl_find_hole to speed up sound
	  card registration.
