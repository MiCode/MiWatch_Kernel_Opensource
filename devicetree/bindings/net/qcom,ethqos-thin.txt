* Qualcomm Technologies, Inc. Ethernet thin driver (GMAC)

This documents dwmmac based ethernet device which supports Gigabit
ethernet for single TX and RX DMA channel pair.
There are 2 emac instances with DWMMAC HW version 0x30000000.
Either emac0 or emac1 instance is supported.
For emac0 instance, comaptible should be "qcom,stmmac-ethqos-emac0"

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "qcom,stmmac-ethqos-emac1",

- reg: Address and length of the register set for the device

- reg-names: Should contain register name "stmmaceth"

- interrupts: Should contain the per channel interrupts

- interrupt-names: Should contain per channel interrupt names

- queue: queue index in MTL for this driver

Rest of the properties are defined in stmmac.txt file in same directory

Examples:

	mtl_rx_setup: rx-queues-config {
		snps,rx-queues-to-use = <1>;
		snps,rx-sched-sp;
		queue {
			snps,dcb-algorithm;
			snps,priority = <0x1>;
		};
	};

	mtl_tx_setup: tx-queues-config {
		snps,tx-queues-to-use = <1>;
		snps,tx-sched-sp;
		queue {
			snps,dcb-algorithm;
		};
	};

	emacthin_hw: ethernet@00020000 {
		compatible = "qcom,stmmac-ethqos-emac1";
		reg = <0x20000 0x10000>;
		interrupts-extended = <&intc 0 945 1>;
		interrupt-names = "tx_rx_ch1_intr";
		mac-address = [000000000000]; /* Filled in by U-Boot */

		rx-fifo-depth = <16384>;
		tx-fifo-depth = <16384>;
		snps,mtl-rx-config = <&mtl_rx_setup>;
		snps,mtl-tx-config = <&mtl_tx_setup>;
		queue = <2>
	};
