title: Generic Subsystem Peripheral Image Loader


description: |+
  subsys-pil-slate is a generic peripheral image loader (PIL) driver. It is
  used for loading the firmware images of the slate subsystems into internal
  memory of slate SoC and preparing the subsystem's processor to execute code.
  It's also responsible for restarting slate SoC when it's gets crashed.

          For implementations specific to subsystem PIL nodes. Could be more
          than one.

        description:
          For specifically registering with the interconnect framework, in
          order to satisfy the bandwidth requirements between the DDR and
          the crypto engine. This is so that the secure world can validate
          the PIL images. Only one node per device-tree is required.
